# AI Assistant - Multi-Functional Intelligent Assistant
## Overview
Welcome to the AI Assistant project, a versatile and powerful tool designed to assist users with various tasks. This AI assistant combines several cutting-edge technologies, including FaceNet and MTCNN for face recognition, YOLOv8 for object detection, LLAMA2 for conversational abilities, and integrated text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionalities. Additionally, it is capable of performing casual tasks, such as reading out emails.

Please note that a voice cloning model named Tortoise was not used in this project due to its slow processing speed, which could disrupt the real-time user experience. Instead, we have opted for efficient alternatives to ensure a seamless interaction with the AI assistant.
